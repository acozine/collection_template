# Collection Title
<!-- Add CI and code coverage badges. Sample included below. -->
[![CI](https://github.com/ansible-collections/kubernetes/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/ansible-collections/kubernetes/actions) [![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ansible-collections/kubernetes)](https://codecov.io/gh/ansible-collections/kubernetes)

<!-- Describe the collection and why a user would want to use it. What does the collection do? -->

## Tested with Ansible

<!-- List which versions of Ansible this has been tested with. Must match what is in galaxy.yml. -->

## Requirements

<!--List any external requirements that the collection depends on. This should not be the collections that would be auto-installed, but other requirements, such as a minimum version of an OS etc. -->

### Supported connections
<!-- An optional section for network/cloud etc collections that support only specific connection types (such as HTTPAPI, netconf, etc). -->

## Included content

<!-- Galaxy will eventually list the module docs within the UI, but until that is ready, you may need to either describe your plugins etc here, or point to an external docsite to cover that information. -->

## Using the collection

<!--Include some quick examples that cover the most common use cases for your collection content. -->

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

## Contributing to the collection

<!--Describe how the community can contribute to your collection.  At a minimum, include how and where to create issues so users can report problems or enhancement requests for the collection.  You should also list any requirements/recommended workflow, and testing you want for a smooth merge experience of community PRs. If you are following general Ansible contributor guidelines, you can link to - [Ansible Community Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html). -->


## Release Notes
<!--Add a link to a changelog.md file or an external docsite to cover this information. -->

## Roadmap

<!-- An optional section to include the roadmap for this collection, and the proposed release/versioning strategy so users can anticipate the upgrade/update cycle. -->

## More information

<!-- List out where the user can find additional information, such as working group meeting times, slack/IRC channels, a documentation site for a product this collection works with, etc. The following links should be included: -->

- [Ansible Collection overview](https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview)
